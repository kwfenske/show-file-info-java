
### Show File Info (Java)

by: Keith Fenske, https://kwfenske.github.io/

ShowFileInfo is a Java 1.4 console application to show standard information
about files according to the Java run-time environment: name, size, date, etc.
None of this would be necessary if current operating systems didn't try to be
overly friendly, for example, saying that a file was modified "23 minutes ago"
instead of giving the actual time of day (where the "23 minutes ago" text could
be appended in parentheses).

There is no graphical interface (GUI) for this program; it must be run from a
command prompt, command shell, or terminal window.
